# Field Simulation

This project uses an object-oriented approach with Java to simulate a field
consisting of rabbits, foxes, and hunters.
Rabbits and foxes move around randomly having a certain maximum ages, after some year they start
breading with a certain rate and finally they die. foxes also should
eat rabbits to stay alive. However, hunters don't move, breed or die. They just
hunt from places nearby randomly.
